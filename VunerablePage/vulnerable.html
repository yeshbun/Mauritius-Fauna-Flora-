              <b>Common name:</b> Mauritius Day Geckos
              <b>Scientific name:</b> Phelsuma
              <b>Tree height:</b> 10 m
              <br><br>
              <b>Did you know?</b>Most Geckos are brightly coloured with vivid greens, blues, reds and oranges.They have distinctive toe pads that allow them to walk on vertical or overhanging surfaces. The remaining mainland species like to shelter in tree cavities and in tightly packed clusters of leaves of the type found in native Palm species and Screwpines (Vacoas species) and in the introduced Traveller’s palm (Ravenala madagascariensis). Day Geckos feed on insects and other invertebrates and also nectar, pollen and fruits. There are 70 known species and subspecies in the world, most of which are found in Madagascar and islands of the southwest Indian Ocean.

              <b>Tree Height:</b> 15m
              <br><br>
              <b>Did you know?</b>The plant is a popular and commonly used medicinal plant in Mauritius and Réunion, where it is commonly harvested from the wild for local use. It also provides a useful timber. This species is said to be cultivated for its medicinal use in China, However, the identity of Ochrosia borbonica is somewhat doubtful.<br>
              Less than 50 individuals are known on Mauritius. The species is also rare and scattered in forests on Réunion. The plant is currently classified as 'Endangered' in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species(2013), though more information may indicate 'Critically Endangered' is a more appropriate category

              <b>Size:</b> 30 cm
              <br><br>
              <b>Did you know?</b> The Telfair Skink was once numerous on Mauritius and offshore islands like Flat Island. Due to habitat destruction and introduced species like goats, black rats, and rabbits, it has been limited to Round Island since the middle of the 19th century. 
              When Gerald Durrell visited Round Island in the 1970s he recorded 5,000 specimens. He brought some specimens to the Jersey Zoo to build up a captive breeding program. Since the eradication of the goats and rabbits on Round Island the skink population has increased to the point that some could be relocated to other islands, like Gunner's Quoin (Coin du Mire) and the Île aux Aigrettes</p>

            <b>Tree Height:</b> 12 m

            <b>Did you know?</b> This species is one of nine species of palm which are indigenous to Mauritius. In the 1700s, this palm species was described from specimens taken from the mountain Pieter Both, where it seems to have been widespread at the time.
            
            Currently, only the single specimen exists in Curepipe Botanic Gardens, and it is not known if this specimen was planted here, or was a survivor from the area's wild population that became included when the gardens were established.
